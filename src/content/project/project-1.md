## Overview
The **DEEPP Amazon Project** is a data-driven initiative executed in 2024 by Ahmad Bukhari. The project focuses on analyzing and optimizing promotional strategies for Amazon India Clothing—a competitive sector in e-commerce—to drive sales performance, refine product category offerings, and improve order fulfilment efficiency.

## Project Background
Amazon India Clothing has been challenged by inconsistent sales growth despite various promotional efforts. In today’s competitive market, understanding regional consumer behavior and product preferences is crucial. This project investigates:
- **Regional Sales Dynamics:** Identifying top-performing markets (e.g., Maharashtra, Karnataka) and potential opportunities in under-tapped regions.
- **Product Category Performance:** Evaluating popular categories such as ‘Set’ and ‘Kurta’ and exploring new growth areas like ‘Saree’.
- **Operational Challenges:** Addressing high order cancellation and return rates that adversely affect profitability.

## Problem & Objectives

### Problem Statement
Despite active promotional campaigns, the key challenges include:
- **Decreasing Sales:** Sales are not growing consistently across all regions.
- **Inefficient Promotions:** Not all promotions yield the desired boost in orders.
- **Fulfilment Issues:** A high percentage of orders end up being cancelled or returned.

*Core Business Question:*  
**How can Amazon India Clothing increase sales by about 10% in the next quarter?**

### Objectives
- **Assess Promotional Impact:** Quantify how promotions influence order volume and average order value.
- **Identify High-Potential Regions:** Leverage regional insights to tailor marketing strategies.
- **Optimize Promo Frequency:** Determine the optimal number of promotions per order to balance customer attraction and order reliability.
- **Enhance Data Collection:** Improve tracking and customer data to facilitate deeper analysis in future campaigns.

## Data & Methodology
The project is based on a comprehensive dataset containing order-level sales data from Amazon India Clothing, covering key promotional periods. The approach includes:

- **Data Collection & Cleaning:**  
  Extraction of order details (ID, date, amount, product category, and promotional status) followed by data cleaning to ensure accuracy.

- **Analytical Tools:**  
  Utilization of Python for statistical analysis and Tableau for creating an interactive dashboard that visualizes regional performance, product trends, and promotional impact.

- **A/B Testing:**  
  Orders were divided into control (non-promo) and treatment (promo) groups. The analysis revealed significant differences in metrics such as the Average Order Value (AOV)—with treatment orders averaging 671.28 compared to 508.78 for the control group—and a statistically significant p-value.

## Key Insights & Findings
- **Promotional Influence:**  
  Orders influenced by promotional activities are the main driver for sales, underscoring the importance of targeted marketing strategies.

- **Regional Performance:**  
  - **Top-performing regions:** Maharashtra and Karnataka.
  - **Opportunities:** Regions with high population densities such as Bihar, West Bengal, and Gujarat show untapped potential.

- **Product Categories:**  
  - **High Demand:** ‘Set’ and ‘Kurta’ are leading categories.
  - **Growth Opportunity:** With better promotion, the ‘Set’ category could capture even more market share, while exploring niche segments like ‘Saree’ may offer additional growth.

- **Optimal Promo Strategy:**  
  Using a single promo per order strikes the best balance between boosting sales and reducing cancellations. Orders with excessive promotions (3 or more) tend to have higher cancellation and return rates.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the project suggests several actionable strategies:
- **Tailored Regional Campaigns:**  
  Focus resources on high-performing regions while implementing specific strategies to penetrate under-performing but populous areas.
  
- **Optimized Promotion Limits:**  
  Limit the use of promotions to 2–3 per order to maximize conversion without triggering excessive cancellations.
  
- **Product Focus:**  
  Enhance promotional efforts for top-performing categories like ‘Set’ and ‘Kurta’ and strategically expand into promising segments like ‘Saree’.
  
- **Enhanced Data Practices:**  
  Improve data tracking—particularly by incorporating customer identifiers and complete shipment tracking—to allow for more personalized marketing and more robust future analyses.
