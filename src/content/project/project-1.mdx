## Overview
In this project, I took a comprehensive, data-driven approach to analyze promotional strategies for Amazon India Clothing. My goal was to understand how promotions impact sales performance, product category trends, and order fulfilment—ultimately finding ways to boost sales by around 10% in the next quarter.

This project not only showcases my analytical skills but also demonstrates my ability to leverage tools like Python for A/B testing and Tableau to drive actionable insights in the e-commerce landscape.

## Project Background
Amazon India Clothing has faced challenges with consistent sales growth despite various promotional efforts. Recognizing that understanding regional consumer behavior and product preferences is key, I focused on:
- **Regional Sales Dynamics:** Identifying top-performing markets (such as Maharashtra and Karnataka) and exploring opportunities in under-tapped regions.
- **Product Category Performance:** Evaluating popular categories like ‘Set’ and ‘Kurta’ while also identifying growth potential in areas like ‘Saree’.
- **Operational Challenges:** Addressing issues like high order cancellation and return rates that negatively impact profitability.

## Problem & Objectives

### Problem Statement
Despite active promotional campaigns, I found that:
- **Sales are decreasing:** There isn’t consistent growth across all regions.
- **Promotions are not fully effective:** Not every promotion translates into a significant boost in orders.
- **Order fulfilment issues persist:** A significant number of orders are cancelled or returned.

**Core Business Question:**
*How can Amazon India Clothing increase sales by about 10% in the next quarter?*

### Objectives
- **Assess Promotional Impact:** Measure how promotions affect order volume and average order value.
- **Identify High-Potential Regions:** Use regional insights to create targeted marketing strategies.
- **Optimize Promo Frequency:** Find the ideal number of promotions per order to maximize customer engagement without increasing cancellations.
- **Enhance Data Collection:** Improve tracking and customer data collection to support deeper analysis in future projects.

## Data & Methodology
I worked with a detailed dataset containing order-level sales data from Amazon India Clothing over key promotional periods. My approach included:

- **Data Collection & Cleaning:**
  Extracting essential order details (ID, date, amount, product category, promotional status) and cleaning the data to ensure its accuracy.

- **Analytical Tools:**
  I utilized Python for statistical analysis and Tableau for creating an interactive dashboard, which helped visualize regional performance, product trends, and the impact of promotions.

- **A/B Testing:**
  By splitting orders into control (non-promo) and treatment (promo) groups, I observed significant differences in the Average Order Value (AOV)—with promo orders averaging 671.28 compared to 508.78 for non-promo orders. The statistical analysis confirmed that these differences were significant.

## Key Insights & Findings
- **Promotional Influence:**
  Promotional activities are a major driver of sales, highlighting the need for targeted strategies.

- **Regional Performance:**
  - **Top-performing regions:** Maharashtra and Karnataka.
  - **Opportunities:** Regions like Bihar, West Bengal, and Gujarat, which have large populations, show significant untapped potential.

- **Product Categories:**
  - **High Demand:** ‘Set’ and ‘Kurta’ lead the market.
  - **Growth Opportunity:** Better promotion of the ‘Set’ category could further boost sales, and exploring niche segments such as ‘Saree’ might open new opportunities.

- **Optimal Promo Strategy:**
  A single promo per order seems optimal for boosting sales while keeping cancellations low. Orders with too many promotions (3 or more) tend to see increased cancellations and returns.

## Recommendations
Based on my analysis, I recommend the following strategies:
- **Tailored Regional Campaigns:**
  Focus on high-performing regions while developing specific strategies for populous but under-performing areas.

- **Optimized Promotion Limits:**
  Limit promotions to 2–3 per order to maximize conversions without increasing the risk of cancellations.

- **Product Focus:**
  Increase promotional efforts for top-performing categories like ‘Set’ and ‘Kurta’, and consider expanding into promising segments like ‘Saree’.

- **Enhanced Data Practices:**
  Improve data collection by incorporating customer identifiers and comprehensive tracking to enable more personalized marketing and deeper analyses in the future.

## Visualizations & Tools
I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides real-time insights into:
- Regional sales trends.
- The impact of promotional activities.
- Product category performance.

## Conclusion
In summary, the DEEPP Amazon Project demonstrates how a thorough, data-driven analysis can uncover actionable strategies to overcome sales challenges. By optimizing promotions, targeting high-potential regions, and refining product strategies, I have outlined a clear path to achieving a 10% sales increase in the next quarter. This project reflects my commitment to using data for strategic decision-making and highlights my practical experience with analytical tools in a competitive e-commerce environment.
