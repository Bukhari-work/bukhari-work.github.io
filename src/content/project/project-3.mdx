# PADI UMKM Customer Segmentation

**Milestone:** 2 – Virtual Internship
**By:** Ahmad Bukhari
**Website:** [PaDi UMKM](https://www.padiumkm.id/)

## Overview

This project leverages data analytics to drive the mission of PaDi UMKM—connecting Indonesian MSMEs with government buyers. Through customer segmentation, the initiative not only enhances buyer relationships but also empowers MSME sellers by tailoring support based on their unique needs.

## Project Background

The rapid expansion of digital transactions among Indonesian MSMEs has generated a wealth of business data—from detailed order histories to comprehensive user interactions. Recognizing this trend, PaDi UMKM identified the pressing need for a robust monitoring system to manage and analyze these diverse datasets effectively.

By implementing proper data monitoring and leveraging customer segmentation, this project aims to uncover actionable insights that drive our core objectives: enhancing buyer engagement and empowering sellers with tailored support. This strategic approach not only strengthens our connections with government buyers but also optimizes the overall performance of the marketplace.

## Problem & Objectives

### Problem Statement
> **How can we leverage customer and seller segmentation to increase buyer engagement and boost seller revenue within the next 6 months?**

### Objectives
- **Enhance Buyer Relationships:** Develop targeted, personalized approaches to boost procurement and engagement.
