# Q-Commerce Demand Forecasting
This project showcases my ability to apply forecasting techniques for data-driven inventory optimization, turning complex data into actionable insights for efficient stock planning in q-commerce.

## Overview
The **Q-Commerce Demand Forecasting** project was designed to optimize stock planning for a newly established e-commerce hub. By forecasting demand for **August 2022** with approximately **80% accuracy**, the project addressed past challenges related to stock mismanagement that led to revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction. Through comprehensive data analysis, model selection, and evaluation, the project delivers actionable insights into sales trends and inventory optimization.

## Project Background
In **January 2022**, a new hub was launched. However, previous months experienced significant challenges in stock planning that resulted in:
- **Revenue Loss:** Incorrect stock levels led to missed sales opportunities.
- **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Stock shortages caused delays and unfulfilled orders.

This project was initiated to ensure that the hub's inventory is efficiently managed, ultimately enhancing operational success and customer satisfaction.

## Problem & Objectives

### Problem Statement
> **How can we forecast demand for August 2022 with approximately 80% accuracy to optimize stock levels?**

### Objectives
The project set out to:
- **Identify a Suitable Forecasting Method:** Evaluate various models to determine the most appropriate approach.
- **Deliver an Accurate Demand Forecast:** Achieve around 80% accuracy in predicting demand for August 2022.
- **Provide Actionable Insights:** Offer recommendations to improve stock planning and reduce losses.

## Data & Methodology
- **Data Source:** Historical sales and stock data provided insights into trends and seasonality.
- **Methodological Steps:**
  - **Preliminary Analysis:** Explored data to identify underlying patterns.
  - **Stationarity Check:** Evaluated data stationarity to determine if transformation was needed.
  - **Model Selection:** Applied the Holt-Winters method for non-stationary series due to its effectiveness in handling trends and seasonality.
  - **Forecast Analysis:** Generated forecasts and evaluated them using error metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Forecasting Models & Analysis
The forecasting process included several critical steps:
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the appropriate forecasting model based on data patterns.
- **Pattern Identification & Stationarity Analysis:** Ensured that data trends were properly accounted for.
- **Forecast Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using key error metrics.

**Evaluation Results:**
- **High Errors (>90% MAPE):** Certain categories (e.g., C, G, and J) showed high relative errors, indicating poor model performance despite sometimes low absolute errors.
- **Moderate Errors `(70%-90% MAPE)`:** Categories F, H, and I exhibited moderate error levels, with some hubs demonstrating acceptable performance.
- **Better Errors `(<70% MAPE)`:** A few instances, such as Category I in specific hubs, approached acceptable forecasting accuracy.

## Recommendations & Future Steps
Based on the evaluation, several recommendations were proposed:
- **Optimize Stock Planning:** Use the forecast to align inventory levels more closely with anticipated demand.
- **Model Refinement:** Improve forecast accuracy for categories with high error rates by exploring additional data features or alternative models.
- **Promotional Insights:** Analyze the impact of promotions on sales to further refine forecasting during promotional periods.
- **Continuous Forecasting:** Implement a dynamic forecasting framework that leverages real-time data for ongoing accuracy improvements.

## Conclusion
The **Q-cCommerce Demand Forecasting** project successfully demonstrates how a structured approach to demand forecasting can enhance stock management. By achieving around 80% accuracy for August 2022, the project not only addressed immediate inventory challenges but also laid the groundwork for continuous improvements in forecasting practices.
