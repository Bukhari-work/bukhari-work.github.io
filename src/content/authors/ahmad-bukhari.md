Driven by a commitment to data analytics and problem-solving, I systematically dissect challenges to identify their core issues and develop actionable solutions. During a recent mock project at RevoU, I applied data-driven analysis to recommend a sales promotion strategy, resulting in a remarkable 10% surge in sales for an emulated company. This hands-on experience underscores my capability to deliver significant outcomes through targeted analytical approaches.

Recognised for my meticulous attention to detail and collaborative spirit, I thrive in team-driven environments where strong communication and proactive problem-solving are key. My unique blend of technical proficiency and commitment to teamwork positions me to contribute effectively to any organisation aiming for impactful growth.
