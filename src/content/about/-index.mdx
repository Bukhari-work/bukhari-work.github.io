I'm a Jakarta-based data analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. My work spans data visualization, predictive modeling, and the integration of technology with business strategy.

### My journey
<Tabs client:load>
  <Tab name="Journey">
    While earning my Bachelor's in Nuclear Engineering at UGM, I discovered that data held the key to solving complex challenges. This insight led me to explore data analytics more deeply—first through the everyday power of Excel and later by diving into more complex tools with RevoU in 2024.

    By 2025, after graduating from the RevoU Data Analytics Program, I had mastered the art of transforming raw data into actionable insights and compelling stories.

    ####  Getting My Degree
    While pursuing my Bachelor's in Nuclear Engineering at UGM, I initially viewed Excel as just another tool for a few assignments. However, as I integrated it into every aspect of my academic work, its true potential began to unfold.

    I quickly found myself relying on Excel not only for coursework but also for managing personal finances, organizing daily tasks, and even scheduling my time. This hands-on experience transformed Excel from a simple assignment helper into a powerful platform for deriving insights from raw data.

    The more I used it, the more I recognized its ability to reveal hidden patterns and streamline complex processes. This realization was a turning point, sparking my deep interest in data analytics and setting me on a journey to explore more sophisticated tools and techniques in the field.

    #### Transforming Into a Legit Data Analyst
    My journey into the realm of data analytics reached a transformative phase when attending the RevoU Full-Stack Data Analytics Course. The program’s curriculum was a deep dive into the tools and methodologies that are at the heart of modern data analysis. I was introduced to a range of advanced tools—from Python for data manipulation and statistical analysis, to SQL for robust database management, and visualization platforms like Tableau and PowerBI that helped bring data to life.

    Each module of the program was designed to challenge and expand my skills. I worked on real-world assignments that required me to extract insights from vast datasets, build predictive models, and create interactive dashboards that told compelling stories.

    One memorable project involved analyzing sales data to identify the effect of promotions on revenue. It required me to integrate multiple tools: querying databases with SQL, cleaning and processing data in Python, and finally visualizing the findings in a Tableau dashboard. This comprehensive experience not only sharpened my technical abilities but also honed my storytelling skills, as I learned to present complex insights in an accessible manner.

    The environment at RevoU was both rigorous and inspiring. The mentorship and peer collaboration provided a supportive backdrop that made every challenge an opportunity to learn. By the end of the program, I had not only acquired a robust toolkit of data analytics techniques but also a renewed confidence in my ability to transform raw data into actionable, strategic insights.

### My Studies
<Accordion client:load title="Bachelor's">
  <a href="/project" className="hover:text-gray-400 dark:hover:text-gray-400">Bachelor of Nuclear Engineering</a>
  with a GPA of 3.56/4.00

  I’m not one to measure intelligence solely by a GPA, though it does offer a glimpse into one’s level of dedication.

  My 3.56 may not be a bragging right, but it reflects the grit needed in a field where every fraction matters. In nuclear engineering, the bar is set high for perfection, yet I tackled the inevitable challenges head-on—proving that consistent effort, one carefully crafted spreadsheet at a time, truly counts.

Certifications might not instantly transform someone into a data wizard, but they do prove that one can wrangle the chaos of raw data into something meaningful.

At RevoU, I dove deep into real-world datasets with tools like Python, SQL, and state-of-the-art visualization platforms.

It wasn’t about flashy accolades—it was about rolling up my sleeves and turning messy numbers into clear, actionable insights. No sugar-coating here, just a lot of hard work, a dash of humor, and the persistent pursuit of making data work for real-world decisions.
